I participated in Iteration 2 and contributed/completed the following tasks.
1. Coding the Username, Theme, Game and difficulty screens.
2. Integrating all the screens. (Ensure that one screen leads to another and that all screens follow the same design language)
3. Coding the use case for when there's more than one player. (Outside the happy path)
